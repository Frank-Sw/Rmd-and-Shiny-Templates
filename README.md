# R Markdown and Shiny App Templates

This repository contains my frequently used templates for R Markdown and Shiny apps. It may updated in the future to contain all templates, including LaTeX/Beamer and other languages.

## Ownership

Many templates I used hvae either been inspired or taken wholesale from others, I have attributed authors/resources where possible within each template folder using folder specific Readme.md files.
